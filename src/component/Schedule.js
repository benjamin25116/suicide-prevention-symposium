      "While suicide is a silent pandemic, child and adolescent suicides are the hidden pandemic. Breaking the silence and stigma of suicide begins with giving voice to the voiceless population of our world. Preventing homicides, suicides and non-fatal violence requires comprehensive multisectoral approaches that cover not only health and mental health services, but also go beyond the health sector and deal with the underlying causes, such as gender and socioeconomic inequalities, social norms that allow violence, access to highly hazardous pesticides, and irresponsible reporting by the media.",

      "Suicide is the silent stalker of the lives of children and adolescents. Teachers are essential in breaking the silence, stigma and discrimination against those who struggle with suicidal and self-harming thoughts. Strategies for improving suicide prevention efforts include in-school trainings on mental health resources and procedures, regular updates on these trainings, and greater visibility of mental health staff and collaboration between departments within the school setting.",

      "There are many ways of committing suicide. Addiction related suicide is one such method. Underlying mental health issues often result in self-medicating in order to forget or numb, or more seriously, they harbor a wish to die to the pain associated with these mental health issues. Research proves that there is a strong relationship between substance abuse and suicide. The focus needs to be not just on the evidence for a link between addiction use/abuse and suicidal behavior, but also on possible clinical or biological factors that may mediate this link, and the implications of this evidence for suicide prevention.",

      'Conversations on suicide rarely ever take into consideration philosophical perspectives on the topic. But every dialogue on suicide, and suicide prevention, bears the weight of fundamental questions about the meaning of life. Albert Camus the 19th century philosopher, originally from the geopolitically fractured French colony in northern Africa, Algeria, challenges human beings to think honestly about suicide. In his essay on suicide, "The Myth of Sisyphus," he begins, "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide..." Hence we are confronted with reconceptualizing and reframing some basic assumptions in our thinking about  suicide.',
