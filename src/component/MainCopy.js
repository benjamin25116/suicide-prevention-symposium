			<Heading>Let’s Talk About Suicide Prevention Together</Heading>
			<p>
				As the world battles with Covid-19, another war rages in Malaysia. Our
				nation is fighting against a silent pandemic, the soaring number of
				suicides in the country. In these uncertain times, everyone is at risk
				of suicide, but the situation is most dire among the most vulnerable
				populations of our society: the neglected, the traumatized and the
				abused.
			</p>
			<p>
				Trapped by cultural, political and religious stigmas and prohibitions,
				those at risk are silenced and isolated by shame and blame,
				meaninglessness and hopelessness. In their inner darkness and confusion,
				the stigma of suicide keeps them from reaching out for help.
			</p>
			<p>
				One crucial element of suicide prevention is the fact that suicide has
				many faces. Some of these faces are hidden and unacknowledged.
			</p>
			<p>
				Itʼs been said that it takes a village to raise a child. Thereʼs an
				innate desire to help, but so far, weʼve grappled with the problem in
				isolation within our own fields of expertise and thatʼs why we need to
				discuss this together.
			</p>
			<p>
				This symposium is a first attempt at creating space to openly talk about
				our concerns, our hopes and our plans for our people and for the
				generations that are to come. We need to hear, argue, agree and
				disagree, be enlivened and renewed in our vision, and in the spirit of
				mutuality, respect, safety, to trust and hope that together we are
				stronger and have more resources to share with each other. We are not
				better than each other; we are better together.
			</p>
			<p>
				Weʼre bringing together, as a community, experts from various
				disciplines and they include educators, academicians, lawyers, doctors,
				and mental health and social work professionals. Join us as we meet and
				hear the perspectives of social workers, addiction counselors, school
				principals, medical doctors, therapists, teachers and clinicians.{" "}
				<em>ALL</em> of us are in this together: to lessen suicidal deaths and
				reduce the despair in our homes, workplaces, schools, and communities.
				Letʼs talk.
