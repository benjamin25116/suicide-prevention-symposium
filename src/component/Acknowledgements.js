        The past year has been a difficult for many. It is organizations like
        PERKAMA and Malaysia Association for Social Workers that hold up beacons
        of hope and encouragement to many of us. We want to thank them for their
        support and backing. Your partnership was not only in words but in
        deeds. We are grateful. Thank you.

        To the team at Dignity who worked many hours behind the scenes in order
        to make this symposium a success, we offer our thanks to you. Without
        you this symposium would have remained in our minds but you took our
        ideas and thoughts and translated them into this event. How can we thank
        you enough. But we will try - thank you.

        To Rev. Elisha Satvinder and Petrina Satvinder, your pioneering spirit
        greets each new adventure with a big YES let's do it. Thank you for
        saying YES to this symposium.

        Sai Fun, Dignity has adopted you as part of our staff. Why won't we: you
        answer our questions asked at absurd hours of the night; you limp,
        squint and squeal because you forgot that you needed to take a break to
        relax, give your eyes some rest and take more washroom breaks ðŸ¤£. There
        is only one of you in a million (perhaps two millions). And you are a
        brilliant copywriter to boot. We got ourselves a great partnership when
        you came aboard. Thank you for all the hours given sacrificially without
        complaint and reimbursement.
      </p>
