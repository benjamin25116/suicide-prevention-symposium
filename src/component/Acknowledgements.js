			<Heading>A Note of Thanks</Heading>
			<p>
				The past year has been a difficult one for many mental health and social
				welfare organizations. Our interactions with our sponsors, PERKAMA and
				Malaysia Association for Social Workers, never failed to encourage us.
				We want to thank Dato‚Äô Dr. Halim Hussin, Puan Amy Bala and Dr. Azlinda
				Azman, for their strong and steady support during the planning of the
				symposium. Your warmth, kindness, enthusiasm and words of wisdom, saw us
				through many challenges. Your partnership with us was not only in words,
				it was followed through in actions. We are very grateful. Your
				organizations are beacons of hope and encouragement to many of us.
			</p>

				To Rev Elisha Satvinder and Petrina Satvinder: From the very conception
				of Dignity, your pioneering spirit has greeted every new challenge and
				endeavor with a big ‚ÄúYES‚Äù and a ‚ÄúLet's do it‚Äù. You epitomize the phrase,
				‚ÄúTo boldly go where no man has gone before‚Ä¶" (Dillard, J). Thank you for
				saying a big YES to this symposium.
			</p>
			<p>
				It would be easy to forget the most important contributors to this
				event. Behind the scenes, a group has worked in order to make this
				symposium a success. To each staff member on this team, the deepest
				thank you and gratitude are due to you for so willingly putting in your
				hard work, time and tireless energy. Without you, this symposium would
				merely have remained in the mind, but you took the thoughts and ideas
				and translated them into this event.

				, Dignity has adopted you as one of its staff. Why wouldn‚Äôt we? You
				answered our questions, responded to requests for help at absurd hours
				of the day and night; you limped, squinted and squealed because you
				forgot that you needed to take a break to relax, to give your eyes some
				rest and to take more washroom breaks ü§£. We got ourselves a great
				partnership when you 'came aboard' and a brilliant copywriter to boot.
				We owe you an unrepayable debt. Thank you is not big enough a word to
				express our gratitude for your work.
